This folder holds the problem domain, the DEVIATION-RULES/THEORIES for this domain, and the problems (PDDL and SHOP3).

The problems are all taken from the SHOP3 distribution, in the `examples` directory.

The domain and problem files have been copied over from SHOP3.  The replan portion of the
experiments required a slight modification to the domain; although this version
is available in SHOP2's examples, we did not want to change the referenced domain
in the problem files.  This directory has those modified problem files.
